### SM3 Relative Projects
- [Project 1](#Project): Do your best to optimize SM3 implementation.
- [Project 2](#Project): Implement the naive birthday attack of reduced SM3 (64 bit, 32 bit or more shorter).

> Notice that the above three projects are implemented in one Xcode project because we need the SM3 implementation for SM3 Birthday attack.
